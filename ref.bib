  abstract  = {X-ray computed tomography (XCT) offers a promising non-destructive method to assess high value components that are additively manufactured (AM) for space-based imaging. However, AM components can be often challenging to measure and the true resolution of the XCT system used is both non-trivial to determine and may change locally. To solve this, we used high precision micro-machining to manufacture a cylindrical reference pin with internal holes. This pin can then be inserted into any component via subtractive machining, prior to the XCT process. A pre-existing AM flexure is modified to allow our modular system to be implemented. This allows XCT scanning and porosity analysis of similar components (similar geometry and manufacturing process) to be refined and adjusted based on the known internal micro-machined hole size. Analysis of the XCT volumetric data is implemented using a Python script developed for Avizo 2022.1, to compare and suggest the ideal threshold grey value (GV). The plugin threshold comparison is semi-automatic and 15 times faster than a manual comparison. Study findings showed how different calibrated micro-machined hole sizes (30 μm–120 μm) needed different thresholding values (188 GV–195 GV). Challenges and future studies related to traceability of the suggested method are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Ductile grinding on a dicing saw is a viable technique for producing optical waveguides and facets in brittle materials, particularly commercially produced lithium niobate waveguides. However, to date, the literature has focused on empirically defined parameters with little investigation of the grinding dynamics. In this study, we first review the formation of lithium niobate waveguides using a dicing saw to determine what parameters the community is employing. We then perform a series of grinding experiments to explore key process parameters, e.g., cut depth and feed rate, in optical quality grinding of lithium niobate. This work is the first large-distance grinding investigation in this important material. Our literature review shows that the optical dicing community normally finds that optical quality is easy to achieve in ductile mode, though the dynamics of this process are not well defined. However, our work shows that processing speed is limited by the blade wear rate prior to a significant roughness increase. We propose a blade wear-rate transition within the ductile regime, which can be approached by cut depth or feed-rate adjustment. Finding the blade wear-rate transition point provides optimal parameters to maximise throughput with minimal blade wear for the highest manufacturing efficiency.},
